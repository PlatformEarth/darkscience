A vocational architect, Dil is now working to develop new tools for human collaboration, understanding and decision making, with a particular concern for public engagement with the reality of complex systems.

My 25 year practice as an architect has been informed by a methodology introduced by Christopher Alexander in 1977.
This approach, ‘Pattern Language’, offers a powerful tool for identifying, documenting, analysing, and tracing interactions between recurring patterns in the complex system encompassing people, society and place - the field of architecture. It was prefigured in a widely cited article, ‘A City is not a Tree’ [Alexander , 1968], which identified characteristics of complexity in such systems.

This work had wide influence beyond architecture, notably within computing, [influencing Ward Cunningham, a collaborator here], the ‘Design Patterns’ movement, and the agile approach to software development.
After spending time at UC Berkeley studying with and working for Alexander, I worked using many aspects of this approach, growing to understand it thoroughly.

Around 2000, it became clear to me that humanity was experiencing diminishing rates of return on reductivist approaches - the classical mode of science.

All the important issues - biology, climate, disease, large-scale social dynamics, neuroscience - require systemic understanding and modelling for progress with the big problems.

But while science develops the capacity to address systems, the general public needs to engage too; -but beyond some superficial cliches like ‘butterfly effect’ and ‘chaos theory’, there is lack of public language required for discussion of such systemic subjects - at a time when such debate is vital. I presented a talk on this at a Citizen Science event in 2017.
This project proposal addresses this need head-on - facilitating structured debates with representative assemblies to generate a spread of information from varied communities, working to analyse and identify recurrent features of that information, characterise, enrich and map, then using that map as a resource from which to produce public engagement events.I am simultaneously working on a Pattern Language building project around Quality of Life at Work - developing tools for collection, engagement and development of patterns
