Trained as a doctor and scientist, David has worked in many fields - multimedia, publishing, communication, education, performance. Connecting these is a thread of deep concern for designing environments for more effective communication, understanding and decision making.

David has extensive and diverse experience of team leadership and management, with a particular emphasis on managing creative teams, community engagement and open source developer communities. His style is facilitatory and flexile with extensive knowledge in modern agile development methodology, as used by small open source programming teams.

David, was a director of the board of Finsbury Park SRB for 5 years, with an annual budget of £5 million, and as Senior Developmental Editor for Times Mirror Publishing was responsible for a new media budget of just over £1 million.
However, the project management of this international collaboration is complex and requires the development of specialist techniques and tooling. Once in place the ability to continue the forms of dialogue with diverse communities on an ongoing basis may prove of lasting value to the science communication activities of the Wellcome Trust and Wellcome Collection. David's experience and role in structuring this collaboration is central.

David has considerable experience of working with decentralised teams, and in the use of a range of modern tools that can facilitate such work. Much of the technological specialisation involved in blockchain and decentralised architectures (IPFS, DAT, Secure Scuttlebut), and many of the governance issues (partnerships, open source consortia, decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised governance) involve a full familiarity with the issues involved in such decentralised working practice.

In this capacity the project has teamed up with the experienced event producer Miroslav Wiesner. Miroslav has many years experience with large scale international collaborations and his organisation is moving into the specialist area of complex interdisciplinary media collaborations. It is therefore proposed that SPC (Creative Associates) manage the financial, scheduling and subcontracting aspects of the project, and that together they develop bespoke open source systems and templates for managing ongoing radio and podcasting collaborations with the Wellcome Trust.

Davids unique experience is interdisciplinary creative team management, and community development, both online and offline. He has started two successful community festivals, worked for a number of top advertising and new media agencies, and relevantly for this project has many years experience motivating and coordinating large online open source and creative communities. he has worked extensively in community TV, was on the steering committee for Creative Commons UK, and TimeBanks UK, and is a leading member of the open source LiveCode developer community, helping to raise £493,795 which in 2013 was the most successful software platform community launch ever on KickStarter.
