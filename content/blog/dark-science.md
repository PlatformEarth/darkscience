Dark Science is a controversial term.

The term "dark" is used here to represent the starting point of any human enquiry. The process of epistemology is then metaphorically represented as a journey from the dark to the light. Both have value. The light is not allways the best place to start a journey, and the dark is not the safest place from which to decide.
