# Dark Science
Dark Science brings will create an entirely new form of global conversation around biomedical science - at scale.

Working with our in-house team of radio producers, we will create Citizen Assemblies of scientist, and engage them in unique forms of dialogue with conversational partners drawn from radio stations, podcast communities, patients and online meetups.

Finally we will visualise an epistemic architecture for the future of science collaboration. Working with augmented reality and world renowned story tellers, we will produce a visual synthesis and performance of this work so that it can be experienced emotionally and cognitively as a whole.
